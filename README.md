# login_system
I have created a perfectly functioning and responsive login system with a Sign Up Page that containes a Login Page in the case that the users already have credentials. <br>

Once the login in is verified, the user is directed into a Homepage that contains a personalized welcome message! (it uses the username inserted by the person). <br>

<br>
The user's data are stored in a table which contains the date, the time, the username and the password chosen to login into the website (for privacy reason I have censored the passwords)
